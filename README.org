* wdiff

wdiff helps analyze how difficult it is to spell Spanish words. The objetive
with wdiff is to improve research on spelling skill and may also be useful
for games that require user's to spell /Spanish words/.

wdiff was design to be easy to use and as flexible as possible
to facilitate conducting research on spelling skills.

wdiff determines the difficulty of words based on the following dimensions:
1) Word length - how many letters it has
2) Number of silent letters - letters that don't have a phonemic
   representation (e.g., /h/)
3) Number of graphemes that share their phoneme with other
   graphemes (e.g., /s/ and /z/)

The more of these characteristics a word has, the more difficulty it is
believed that it will be to spell.

* Getting Started
** Installing
=python -m pip install wdiff=

** Usage
   The most basic usage requires you to pass an iterable of words (e.g., list),
   run all possible analyses, and save the results to a file named =results.csv=.
   
#+begin_src python :exports code :session 
  from wdiff.analyzer import Analyzer

  words = ['guitarra', 'jinete', 'serpiente']
  analyzer = Analyzer(words) # create analyzer
  analyzer.run_all_analyses()
  print(analyzer.results) # see results
  analyzer.save_results()
#+end_src

You can further customize which analyses to run, extract the results
as a =pandas.DataFrame=, and choose the name of the results file. 

*Better documentation is coming very soon!*
