* General purpose
Analyze the characteristics of words and determine their difficulty. 
* Requirements
+ Needs to analyze an arbitrary large number of words
+ User should be able to customize which analyses to conduct
+ The results should be retrievable at any point
+ The user should have the option of saving the results to a file
+ Results should be formatted as a pd.DataFrame: flexible, easy to use, and powerful
* Components
** Analyzer 
   Purpose: Provides a public interface for the user 

   This object is a pandas.DataFrame and all interactions should be made through
   the the df.apply's method.
*** Fields
   - results: pandas.DataFrame
*** Actions
   - Create word objects
   - Run analyses specified by the user
   - Transform the str into word objects
   - Store the results of each analysis 
   - Returns the results without the word objects
   - Saves results to file
   - Communicates with word
** Word
  Purpose: Knows how to analyze its characterstics and stores them
*** Fields
    - text
    - letter length
    - silent letters
    - letter with same phoneme
    - total dificulty
*** Actions
**** Analysis
     The interface to the analyses should be properties because it is a
     property of the word (characteristic) that the user is requiring. It should
     cache the results of the analyses so that they are not rerun if the user
     calls them again.
****** check word length
****** Silent letters
******* check silent h
******* check silent u
****** check same sound letters
******* check \/s/ sounds
******* check \/ʎ/ sounds
******* check \/x/ sounds
******* check \/k/ sounds
******* check \/Y/ sounds
******* check \/B/ sounds
****** calculate overall difficulty
**** General
    - Validate word
    - Communicates with analyzer
    - Caches the data
